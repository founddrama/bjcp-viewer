It is a unique (but very well-known) beer that has a very strong, complex malt profile not found in other examples, often leading judges to overly penalize traditional English strong bitters. In America, ESB has been co-opted to describe a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) British-type ale, and is a popular craft beer style. This may cause some judges to think of US brewpub ESBs as representative of this style.","history":"See comments in category introduction. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily \\"more premium\\" since best bitters are traditionally the brewer\'s finest product). British pale ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling (including increasing carbonation levels). While modern British pale ale is considered a bottled bitter, historically the styles were different.","ingredients":"Pale ale, amber, or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English finishing hops are most traditional, but any hops are fair game; if American hops are used, a light touch is required. Characterful British yeast. Burton versions use medium to high sulfate water, which can increase the perception of dryness and add a minerally or sulfury aroma and flavor.","comparison":"More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter, as well as more alcohol. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with British Strong Ales, although Strong Bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter.

Caramel flavors typically absent. Highly attenuated, giving a dry, crisp finish with lingering bitterness, although the body gives an impression of fullness. Medium to medium-high hop flavor, somewhat earthy and possibly herbal, resinous, peppery, or iron-like but not floral, lasting into aftertaste. Medium-high to medium-low esters, often pears and apples. Banana is optional, but should never dominate. May be lightly minerally or sulfury, especially if yeast is present.

Medium to medium-full body, tending to the higher side if poured with yeast. Smooth but gassy. Stronger versions may have a light alcohol warmth, but lower alcohol versions will not. Very well-attenuated; should not have any residual sweetness.","comments":"Coopers has been making their flagship Sparkling Ale since 1862, although the formulation has changed over the years. Presently the beer will have brilliant clarity if decanted, but publicans often pour most of the beer into a glass then swirl the bottle and dump in all the yeast. In some bars, the bottle is rolled along the bar. When served on draught, the brewery instructs publicans to invert the keg to rouse the yeast. A cloudy appearance for the style seems to be a modern consumer preference. Always naturally carbonated, even in the keg. A present-use ale, best enjoyed fresh.","history":"Brewing records show that the majority of Australian beer brewed in the 19th century was draught XXX (Mild) and porter. Ale in bottle was originally developed to compete with imported bottled pale ales from British breweries, such as Bass and Wm Younger\' Monk. By the early 20th century, bottled pale ale went out of fashion and \\"lighter\\" lager beers were in vogue. Many Australian Sparkling and Pale Ales were labeled as ales, but were actually bottom-fermented lagers with very similar grists to the ales that they replaced. Coopers of Adelaide, South Australia is the only surviving brewer producing the Sparkling Ale style.","ingredients":"Lightly kilned Australian 2-row pale malt, lager varieties may be used. Small amounts of crystal malt for color adjustment only. Modern examples use no adjuncts, cane sugar for priming only. Historical examples using 45% 2 row, 30% higher protein malt (6 row) would use around 25% sugar to dilute the nitrogen content.

Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions.","mouthfeel":"Smooth, medium-light to medium body without hop-derived astringency. Medium to medium-high carbonation can give an overall dry sensation despite a supportive malt presence. A low, smooth alcohol warming can be sensed in stronger versions.","comments":"The attributes of IPA that were important to its arrival in good condition in India were that it was very well-attenuated, and heavily hopped. Simply because this is how IPA was shipped, doesn\'t mean that other beers such as Porter weren\'t also sent to India, that IPA was invented to be sent to India, that IPA was more heavily hopped than other keeping beers, or that the alcohol level was unusual for the time.\\nMany modern examples labeled IPA are quite weak in strength. According to CAMRA, \\"so-called IPAs with strengths of around 3.5% are not true to style.\\" English beer historian Martyn Cornell has commented that beers like this are \\"not really distinguishable from an ordinary bitter.\\" So we choose to agree with these sources for our guidelines rather than what some modern British breweries are calling an IPA; just be aware of these two main types of IPAs in the British market today.\\nThe beers were shipped in well-used oak casks, so the style shouldn\'t have an oak or Brett character.","history":"Originally a pale stock ale from London that was first shipped to India in the late 1700s. George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery did not create the style, but was the first well known brewer to dominate the market. After a trade dispute, the East India Company had Samuel Allsopp recreate (and reformulate) the beer in 1823 using Burton\'s sulfate-rich water. The name India Pale Ale wasn\'t used until around 1830. \\nStrength and popularity declined over time, and the style virtually disappeared in the second half of the 20th century. While the stronger Burton-type IPA remained, the name was also applied to hoppy, lower-gravity, often bottled products (a trend that continues in some modern British examples). The style underwent a craft beer rediscovery in the 1980s, and is what is described in these guidelines. \\nModern examples are inspired by classic versions, but shouldn\'t be assumed to have an unbroken lineage with the exact same profile.

It became a highly-popular, widely-exported style in the early 1800s before declining by the 1870s as it changed to a lower gravity, unaged beer. As gravities continued to decline in all UK beers in the first half of the 1900s, styles stopped being made (including porter, gone by the 1950s). The craft beer era led to its re-introduction in 1978. \\nThe name is said to have been derived from its popularity with the London working class performing various load-carrying tasks of the day.

The only common element is that they have the balance and overall impression of an IPA (typically, an American IPA) but with some minor tweak.\\nThe term \'IPA\' is used as a singular descriptor of a type of hoppy, bitter beer. It is not meant to be spelled out as \'India Pale Ale\' when used in the context of a Specialty IPA. None of these beers ever historically went to India, and many aren\'t pale. But the craft beer market knows what to expect in balance when a beer is described as an \'IPA\' \u2013 so the modifiers used to differentiate them are based on that concept alone.\\nThe Specialty IPA category is not intended for Classic-style IPAs with added ingredients (such as fruit, spice, wood, smoke, grains, or sugars) \u2013 these should be entered in the appropriate Specialty-Type beer category (Fruit Beer, SHV Beer, etc.).

Varieties of grape can contribute differently on the flavor profile: in general stone/tropical fruit flavors (peach, pear, apricot, pineapple) can come from white grapes and red fruit flavors (e.g., cherry, strawberry) from red grape varieties. Further fruity character of fermentative origin is also common. Different kinds of special malts can be used but should be supportive and balanced, not so prominent as to overshadow the base beer. Strong roasted and/or chocolate character is inappropriate. Light sour notes, due to the use of grape, are common and may help to improve the drinkability but should not be prominent as in Sour ale/Lambic or similar. Oak flavors, along with some barnyard, earthy, goaty notes can be present but should not be predominant.  Bitterness and hop flavors are low. Diacetyl is absent.","mouthfeel":"Medium-high carbonation improves the perception of aroma. Body is generally from low to medium and some acidity can contribute to increase the perception of dryness.
